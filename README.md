### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Otto from Finland, and I'm a 3rd year Business Information Technology student at LAB University of Applied Sciences. I had no previous experience with programming or coding prior to my studies. During my time at LAB however, I became really passionate about programming and creating different types of applications and web pages. I enjoy creating web pages and other types of applications, but also develop my skillset on my free time. I've produced a few free time coding projects that can be found on my profile, and completed couple of coding courses on Udemy.
