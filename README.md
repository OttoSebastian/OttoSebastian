I'm Otto from Finland, and I'm a 3rd year Business Information Technology student at LAB University of Applied Sciences. I had no previous experience with programming or coding prior to my studies. During my time at LAB however, I became really passionate about programming and creating different types of applications and web pages. I enjoy creating web pages and other types of applications, but also develop my skillset on my free time. I've produced a few free time coding projects that can be found on my profile, and completed couple of coding courses on Udemy.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / TYPESCRIPT / TAILWIND / ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA) / DATA-ANALYTICS / LEAN / SIX SIGMA

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my studies at LAB 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Tailwind and TypeScript
